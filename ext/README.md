# Chrome Extension in Astro ðŸš€

Watch for file changes with:

```
yarn dev
```

This will automatically build the extension with `astro build` into the `dist/` directory.

This example showcases Astro working with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Write the React components as `.jsx` or `.tsx` files.
